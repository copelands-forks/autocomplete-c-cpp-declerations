# Autocomplete C/C++ files

This extension will write the implementation of your C/C++ code without make you copy and paste like an idiot.

this is a fork of [SteveSevetS](https://github.com/SteveSevetS/autocomplete-c-cpp-files/) autocomplete project.

  I intend to make some changes to the source code that allows header autocompletion as well as make it convenient for large scale c++ projects.

Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting a pull request [here](https://github.com/SteveSevetS/autocomplete-c-cpp-files/)
