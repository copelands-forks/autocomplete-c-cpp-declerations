Auto Complete Declerations! C/C==  
  
  a fork of SteveveSevetS's project:
  
    - the purpose of the fork was to expand the extension so that it is useful in large scale c++/c  projects as well as add my own things to it.
    - a lot of source changes has been made and new features are present.
  
  New Features : 
    
    - Trigger auto complete is not limited to single .cpp files where main is enabled,
     it works across all files now. including .h for all those header-only coders.
    
    - trigger key function decleration snippets include the actual namespaces now! 
      
      
    
  Fixes :  
  
    -namespace issue, 
    
    -trigger key "." annoyance
